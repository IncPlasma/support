Listed below are all ranks in the group, along with instructions on how to obtain them. If your application is declined, don’t be discouraged! There is no limit on how many times you can apply, and the person who handles your application will give you advice on how to improve for next time.

**Applying for a rank?**
Send all applications via DMs to a Supervisor. You can find them in our Discord with the green supervisor role & green Plasma Inc badge next to their names.


## Helper
Helpers assist new members in game, on the group wall and in the Discord.

Requirements:
- Have a good understanding of Plasma's games and rules, both in-game and in our Discord servers.
- Be mature.
- Your application must include at least four screenshot examples of you helping people - whether it be on our group walls, or ingame/in the Discord.


## Audio Engineer
Audio engineers are able to voice act, compose music, record sound effects or remix tracks.

Requirements:
- Your application must include at least two examples of your work.


## Artist
Artists are people who are able to create art (concept drawings, paintings, digital drawings), decals, advertisements, textures, animations, etc...

Requirements:
- Your application must include at least two examples of your work.


## Builder
Builders are people within Plasma who are able to create structures, games and other objects within Roblox Studio or various other 3D modelling software, such as Blender. Building basic structures within a Roblox game (for example, using Btools) is also acceptable, although is generally harder to be accepted with. Intermediate/Advanced builders may be invited to work in Plasma Inc. related projects. When applying for any level of Builder, if your build does not meet the desired tier, you may still be awarded the builder rank of another tier. For example, if you applied for Advanced builder, however the work was not considered detailed enough, you may still be voted for Intermediate builder. Currently, Builders are divided into 3 tiers:

- **Novice**- Awarded to people who can create simple models and structures, your application will require at least **2** examples of your work. Novice builds only have the most basic details, for instance a car may consist of basic cylinder wheels, with a texture overlay. The basic shape of a car would be present, although with few other details- wingmirrors or an angled windshield for example.

- **Intermediate**- Awarded to people who can create more detailed models and structures, your application will require at least **4** examples of your work. Intermediate builds would include more details, for instance a car would have a proper interior- with seats depicted, including a steering wheel, wheels which are given spokes, and even more detailed engine work.

-	**Advanced**- Awarded to people who can create complex and intricate models and structures, your application will require at least **6** examples of your work. Advanced builds are usually much larger, with visible details all around, for example a car would have a full engine block accurately depicted in scale, with a full underbody detail made out. There would be pipework underneath and a full interior, with seat lining, and a full dashboard with dials and readouts.


## Scripter
Scripters are people within Plasma who are able to write scripts in the programming language Lua. The script can be written in any application capable of supporting Lua (such as Garry’s mod, web servers or Discord bots for example). At least **1** example should be within Roblox, however the other examples may be on other forms of software if up to a good standard. Intermediate/Advanced scripters may be invited to work in Plasma Inc. related projects. When applying for any level of Scripter, if your script does not meet the desired tier, you may still be awarded the scripter rank of another tier. For example, if you applied for Advanced scripter, however the work was not considered complex enough, you may still be voted for Intermediate Scripter. When applying for all tiers of scripter, your application must include examples of the code used, either uploaded to a paste website, on Github, or sent as a message/screenshot. Currently, Scripters are divided into 3 tiers:

- **Novice**- 

- **Intermediate**-

- **Advanced**-
